# Java 'Kanji Quiz' program

In order to refresh my Java knowledge, I am writing a quiz program for Japanese
Kanji based on C++ code in the 'kanji-tools' repo.

The project is built using `Gradle` in `Intellij` with `Junit 5` for testing and
`JaCoCo` for code coverage. I am attempting to use modern (Java 8) features like
lambdas and java.nio as well as some more recent features introduced such as:

- Java 10: `var`
- Java 14: `switch` expressions
- Java 16: pattern matching for `instance of`

The project JDK version being used is Java 17. I tried using Java 20, but 
ran into some issues with the IDE and `Gradle`.
